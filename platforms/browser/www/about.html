        <h2>About Emotions Count</h2>
        
        <h3>Why Emotions Count?</h3>
        <p>In our ever-changing and busy world, the emotional needs of our children should be a primary focus both at home and at school. Connecting
        the two entities in a mission to provide balance and support for the whole child is an essential component that cannot be overlooked. Empowering
        students with the tools to feel emotionally safe and successful will better equip them to manage emotions and become active problem solvers in their everyday lives.</p>
        
        <p>In a time when state testing and Common Core State Standards are a point of emphasis in our school system, we must ask ourselves one important question: is the emotional
        health & happiness of our children a top priority?</p>
        
        <p>Emotions Count offers teachers, parents, and students a tool for open communication and an efficient method for collecting data to outline strategies to support the emotional
        needs of children of all ages. Students will complete a brief online screener with questions regarding their perceptions of emotional triggers, such as bullying on the playground,
        their own academic success, relationships with peers, as well as other key areas. Their individual responses will provide valuable insight into their current emotional health and
        overall well-being. Furthermore, using the data collected, the screener provides specific strategies to guide teachers and parents to create individualized systems of ongoing support
        and guidance.</p>
        
        <p>This cumulative effort will recognize that emotional health counts and forever plays an integral part in one's health and happiness.</p>
        
        <h3>Who Created Emotions Count?</h3>
        
        <p>Emotions count started as an idea by 4th grade teacher, Gina Greco. Inspired to find a way to support her students, Gina collaborated with Green River College to have this web app
        built as a student project. Benjamin Arnold, Josh Hawks , Satinder Kaur, and Jami Schwarzwalder worked on the project, guided by instructor Tina Ostrander. At the end of the class Jami
        Schwarzwalder continued on with the project, joined by Kimberly Praxel.</p>
